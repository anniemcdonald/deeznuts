The Wonderful World of Web
Welcome to the world of web development! We'll learn a lot (4 languages!) but
will create some pretty great websites by the end of the quarter :)

Why Web Development is Awesome:
- You can create _anything_!
  - An "About Me" page
  - A travel blog
  - An art showcase
  - Interactive games
  - etc.
- There's always something new to learn
- Unlike a Java or Python program, you can show off your hard work with a website link!

Fun Fact
Lorem Ipsum refers to placeholder text when building documents and webpages before content is finalized.
It is also the name of our unofficial course mascot, Lorem!
